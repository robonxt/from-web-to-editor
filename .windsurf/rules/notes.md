do not edit anything in the folder "the-website", that will contain the root, example website that we will try to build the website editor upon.

the website editor will live in the folder "the-editor". Edits and changes are allowed in that folder.

any other file that is not in "the-editor" folder should be treated as read only, or documentation files unless otherwise stated.
